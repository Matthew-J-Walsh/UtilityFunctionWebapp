Everything is functioning perfectly. I am going to delete unused code and comment everything now... Then I will start working on the actual webapp. (7/18/17)

Update for 8/7/17: IT IS RUNNING THE PROGRAM...
LIFE IS GREAT
to get it to run launch the server and go to 127.0.0.1:8000/app/interface/
Then it will load the blank page.
You then can press "Run" and it will change the url at the top for your inputs (currently these have no effect).
After that you can see the output of help text from the program running! (Warning: this takes about 15 seconds to load the page because it has to run the program)
