# UtilityFunctionWebapp
I have no idea what im doing

Use the function utilityCompiler with -pyfile interface.py:
python utilityCompiler -pyfile interface.py

and you will produce something like manfiest_of_interface.py.txt
You can edit that file to eventually change the display settings

an additional benifit is that lots of text will be printed to the screen, and that is good
