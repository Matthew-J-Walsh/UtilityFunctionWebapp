To use the program:
create a script that can take either a dict or command line as inputs

run utilityCompiler.py -f _(your file name)_.py -m

take the manifest file and the script and put it in a folder named the same as the script with a blank __init__.py file.

place that folder in varibleApp/DataFolder

run the server

go to /app/(your file name)

choose your inputs

profit?

example: test.py that is currently in DataFolder

I will work on it being less tedious and more automatic
