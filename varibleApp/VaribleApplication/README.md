The main parts of this project that have to be developed are the following files:
urls.py
views.py
models.py
templates

Matthew will have to work on the templates as they require more knowledge about how views take 
templates, html. and css code to build a webpage

Information on the rest of the things can be found in their respective files

Update 7/31/17: I have tried to do reasearch and work for dealing with widgets, forms, and input in general. I will need templates to work for anything to be testable.
I have tried to build an initial copy of what the forms and template will look like.
